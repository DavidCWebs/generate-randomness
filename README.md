Randomness in Linux
===================
Educational project using various methods to generate pseudo random numbers/strings that are cryptograpically secure.

Random numbers have many important uses in applied cryptography. Yet you can't compute true randomness arithmetically:

>Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin. For, as has been pointed out several times, there is no such thing as a random number â€” there are only methods to produce random numbers, and a strict arithmetic procedure of course is not such a method.
>[John Von Neumann][4]

Computers are deterministic - and predictable. So you can't expect a computer to produce randomness arithmetically. There are many "random" number generators built into programming languages, but these usually produce outputs that have a flavour of randomness - they are not cryptographically secure. You should NOT use such methods to generate random numbers that will be used for non-trivial purposes (e.g. generating private keys).

This repo contrasts random number generation by mean of different userspace libraries and accessing `/dev/urandom` directly. `/dev/urandom` is the interface to the Linux kernel random number generator.

At the moment, I've included random number generation by means of libgcrypt, and I'll add openssl shortly.

/dev/urandom
------------
* Has access to raw device entropy
* Won't share state between applications


OpenSSL
-------
C project that uses the `<openssl/rand.h>` library to generate random data. I found this a bit tricky to set up.

Note that in the `Makefile`, `cc` requires `-lssl -lcrypto` flags.

[RAND_][7] is used to check for sufficient entropy. Note issues re: [libgcrypt entropy loss][8]
