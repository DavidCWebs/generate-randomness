Randomness in Linux
===================
Educational project using various methods to generate pseudo random numbers/strings that are cryptograpically secure.

Random numbers have many important uses in applied cryptography. Yet you can't compute true randomness arithmetically:

>Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin. For, as has been pointed out several times, there is no such thing as a random number â€” there are only methods to produce random numbers, and a strict arithmetic procedure of course is not such a method.
>[John Von Neumann][4]

Computers are deterministic - and predictable. So you can't expect a computer to produce randomness arithmetically. There are many "random" number generators built into programming languages, but these usually produce outputs that have a flavour of randomness - they are not cryptographically secure. You should NOT use such methods to generate random numbers that will be used for non-trivial purposes (e.g. generating private keys).

This repo contrasts random number generation by mean of different userspace libraries and accessing `/dev/urandom` directly. `/dev/urandom` is the interface to the Linux kernel random number generator.

At the moment, I've included random number generation by means of the libgcrypt and openssl userspace libraries.

/dev/urandom as a source of Randomness
--------------------------------------
`/dev/urandom` is a character special file in Linux (including Android) and other \*NIXes that provides access to a source of randomness generated by the Kernel. The randomness is sourced from environmental noise from device drivers and other sources - stored in an entropy pool.

* Has access to raw device entropy
* Won't share state between applications

Most userspace random number generators ultimately rely on `/dev/urandom` in any case - so in your own applications you should consider accessing the API directly rather than through a userspace library like openSSL or libgcrypt.

Access /dev/urandom in C
------------------------
A pretty simple way to access `/dev/urandom` randomness in C is to `fopen()` the file and read the required number of bytes. See [urandom-c/main.c][9]. 

Randomness in BASH
------------------
You can get good randomness directly from within bash - the `/dev/random`/`/dev/urandom` files provide easy access to good random numbers.

For cryptographically secure random numbers suitable for most applications, grab bytes from `/dev/urandom`. You can then represent these bytes as printable characters by converting to base 64 or hexadecimal characters:

```bash
# Get 12 random bytes from /dev/urandom, output in base 64 encoding.
n=12
echo $(head -c $n /dev/urandom | base64)

# Get 12 random bytes as above, output as hex characters.
head -c $n /dev/urandom | xxd -ps
```
For anything that requires even slight security, __do not__ use the [`$RANDOM` internal Bash function][10].

If you want to generate a set of random words, you can use a random number sourced from `/dev/urandom` to lookup a word by line number in a word list provided by  the OS. In Debian/Ubuntu Linux, the `/usr/share/dict/words` file contains 99171 words, each on a separate line. [Example Bash script for creating pseudo-random word list][13].

OpenSSL
-------
C project that uses the `<openssl/rand.h>` library to generate random data. I found this a bit tricky to set up.

Note that in the `Makefile`, `cc` requires `-lssl -lcrypto` flags.

[RAND_][7] is used to check for sufficient entropy. Note issues re: [libgcrypt entropy loss][8]
